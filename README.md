vlandump
========

vlandump is a small utility for capturing network traffic and aggregating found VLAN-tags (if any).
Found tags can then be sorted and displayed. It is based on libpcap and there are two implementations, 
one with own memory management (just for fun) and an array-based one.

See COPYING for information regarding usage and licensing.

See <http://mainini.ch> for more stuff by me and for ways to contact me.
